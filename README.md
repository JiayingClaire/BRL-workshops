### Pre-Workshop Assignment


Before your first workshop, please do the following:

1. Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/

2. Install RStudio Desktop (open source / free version) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

3. Install [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages with:

> install.packages("tidyverse")

I will do my best to accommodate different skill levels, however I will assume a general familiarity of base R. If you haven't used R at all previously, I recommend [DataCamp's free Introduction to R course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r). For our purposes, you can skip the matrices and lists chapters, and the ordered factors section of the factors chapter. 

For book people (like me!) I recommend the "R Nuts and Bolts" chapter of  Roger Peng's [R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming). If you are limited in time, the most important topics to learn / review are: character vs. factor data, and working with data frames. Again, matrices and lists won't come up.

If you're new to ggplot2, please read ["Data Visualization"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) in R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham to gain a general familiarity with ggplot2 functions.

If you're so inclined, please complete this short survey by noon on Monday April 1 -- or noon on Monday April 8 if you're registered only for the second workshop. Your responses will help me get a sense of your skill levels and interests.
